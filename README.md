# [Personal Website](https://luis-c.github.io)

This is the repository for my personal website which is currently built in Angular. 

## Build using:

`ng b --prod --outputPath=../docs/ --baseHref="https://luis-c.github.io/"`

# Notes:

- Don't forget to replace the 404.html files

- Github Pages doesn't seem to give the option to deploy from /docs for a
  personal website.
